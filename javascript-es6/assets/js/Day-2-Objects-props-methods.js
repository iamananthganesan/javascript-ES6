//A shallow copy copies only the top-level properties of an object or array. If those properties are references (like nested objects/arrays), they are not cloned â€” just referenced.

const original = {
  name: "Anand",
  address: {
    city: "Chennai"
  }
};
//Spread operator also do the shallow copy 
const shallowCopy = { ...original };

// Modify nested object in the copy
shallowCopy.address.city = "Bangalore";

console.log(original.address.city); // ðŸ‘‰ "Bangalore" (unexpected change!)


//A deep copy clones all levels of the object or array â€” including any nested objects/arrays. This way, the original and the copy are completely independent.

const originalNew = {
  name: "Anand",
  address: {
    city: "Chennai"
  }
};

const deepCopy = structuredClone(originalNew); // browser-supported (modern)

deepCopy.address.city = "Bangalore";

console.log(original.address.city); // ðŸ‘‰ "Chennai" (unchanged)


//Alternate Deep copy methods
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

//else we can make a use of libraries
import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';

const deepCopy = cloneDeep(original);
